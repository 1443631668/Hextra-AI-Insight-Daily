-   Email address

We use Cookies and similar tracking tech to keep tabs on activity on our Service and stash away certain info. The tracking tech we use includes beacons, tags, and scripts, which help us gather and track info, plus make our Service better and analyze how it's used. The tech we use might include:

-   **Cookies or Browser Cookies**: A Cookie is a tiny file plopped onto your Device. You can tell your browser to say "nope" to all Cookies or to give you a heads-up when one is being sent. But hey, if you don't take Cookies, you might not be able to use some parts of our Service. Unless you've tweaked your browser settings to give Cookies the boot, our Service might just use 'em.
-   **Web Beacons**: Certain bits of our Service and our emails might have tiny electronic files called Web Beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs).

### How Long We Keep Your Personal Data
The Company will only hang onto your Personal Data for as long as it takes to do what we laid out in this Privacy Policy. We'll keep and use your Personal Data as much as needed to stick to our legal duties (like if we gotta hold onto your data to follow the law), sort out disagreements, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.

The Company will also keep Usage Data for internal analysis purposes. Usage Data usually hangs around for a shorter period, unless it's used to beef up the security of our Service or make its functions better, or if we're legally required to keep this data for longer.

### Transferring Your Personal Data
Your info (including Personal Data) gets processed at the Company's operating offices and any other spots where the parties involved in the processing are located. This means your info might get shipped off to and stored on computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other government jurisdiction, where data protection laws might be different from yours.

By agreeing to this Privacy Policy and handing over such info, you're cool with that transfer.

The Company will take all reasonable steps to make sure your data is treated securely and goes along with this Privacy Policy. We won't transfer your Personal Data to any organization or country unless there are adequate controls in place, including the security of your data and other personal info.

### Deleting Your Personal Data
You've got the right to delete your Personal Data, or ask us to help you wipe it out, that we've collected about you.

Our Service might let you zap certain info about yourself right from within the Service.

You can always update, tweak, or delete your info by logging into your account (if you have one) and heading over to the account settings section that lets you manage your personal info. You can also hit us up to ask for access to, correct, or delete any personal info you've given us.

Just a heads-up, though: we might need to hang onto some info when we've got a legal obligation or a legit reason to do so.

### When Your Personal Data Gets Shared

#### Business Transactions
If the Company gets involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your Personal Data might get moved. We'll give you a heads-up before your Personal Data is transferred and ends up under a different Privacy Policy.

#### Law Enforcement
In certain situations, the Company might have to spill your Personal Data if the law says so or if there's a valid request from public authorities (like a court or government agency).

#### Other Legal Requirements
The Company might spill your Personal Data if we genuinely believe such action is necessary to:
-   Follow a legal obligation
-   Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company
-   Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service
-   Protect the personal safety of users of the Service or the public
-   Shield against legal liability

### Keeping Your Personal Data Safe
Keeping your Personal Data safe is a big deal to us, but keep in mind that no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% foolproof. While we really try to use commercially acceptable ways to protect your Personal Data, we can't guarantee its absolute security.

## Kids' Privacy
Our Service isn't aimed at anyone under the age of 13. We don't knowingly collect personally identifiable info from anyone under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you know your kid has given us Personal Data, please hit us up. If we figure out that we've scooped up Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verified parental consent, we'll take steps to wipe that info from our servers.

If we need to lean on consent as a legal basis for processing your info, and your country requires parental consent, we might ask for your parent's OK before we collect and use that info.

## Links to Other Websites
Our Service might have links to other websites that we don't run. If you click on a third-party link, you'll get rerouted to that third party's site. We super recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.

We've got no control over, and don't take any responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We might tweak our Privacy Policy from time to time. We'll let you know about any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy right here on this page.

Before the changes kick in, we'll give you a heads-up via email and/or a prominent notice on our Service, and we'll update the "Last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.

We suggest you take a peek at this Privacy Policy periodically to stay in the loop about any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are good to go once they're posted on this page.
