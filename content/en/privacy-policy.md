### Retention of Your Personal Data
The Company will only hang onto your Personal Data for as long as it takes to fulfill the purposes spelled out in this Privacy Policy. We’ll keep and use your Personal Data to the extent needed to follow our legal obligations (like, if we gotta hold onto your data to comply with applicable laws), iron out disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.

The Company will also hang onto Usage Data for internal analysis. Usage Data is usually kept for a shorter time, unless it’s used to beef up the security or improve the functionality of our Service, or if we're legally on the hook to hold onto this data for longer periods.

### Transfer of Your Personal Data
Your info (including Personal Data) gets processed at the Company’s operating offices and any other spots where the parties involved in the processing are located. This means that this info might get transferred to—and hang out on—computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws might differ from those in your jurisdiction.

By agreeing to this Privacy Policy and handing over such info, you're giving the thumbs up to that transfer.

The Company will take all reasonable steps necessary to make sure your data is handled securely and in line with this Privacy Policy. Your Personal Data won’t get shipped off to any organization or country unless there are solid controls in place, including the security of your data and other personal info.

### Delete Your Personal Data
You've got the right to delete or ask us for a hand in deleting the Personal Data we've collected about you.

Our Service might let you zap certain info about yourself right from inside the Service.

You can always log into your account (if you've got one) and swing by the account settings section that lets you manage your personal info to update, tweak, or delete your info. You can also get in touch with us to ask for access to, correct, or delete any personal info you’ve dished out to us.

But heads up, we might need to hang onto certain info when we’re legally on the hook or have a legitimate reason to.

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
If the Company gets involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your Personal Data might get moved around. We'll give you a heads-up before your Personal Data is transferred and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.

#### Law enforcement
Under certain circumstances, the Company might be forced to spill your Personal Data if the law demands it or in response to valid requests by public authorities (like a court or a government agency).

#### Other legal requirements
The Company might spill your Personal Data in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:
- Stick to a legal obligation
- Protect and defend the Company’s rights or property
- Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing connected with the Service
- Keep Service users or the public safe
- Steer clear of legal liability

### Security of Your Personal Data
Keeping your Personal Data safe is a big deal to us, but just a heads-up: no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% foolproof. While we bust our chops to use commercially acceptable ways to shield your Personal Data, we can’t promise it’s absolutely secure.

## Children's Privacy
Our Service isn't aimed at anyone under the age of 13. We don't knowingly collect personally identifiable info from anyone under 13. If you’re a parent or guardian and you know your kid has given us Personal Data, please get in touch with us. If we find out we’ve scooped up Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verifiable parental consent, we’ll move to scrub that info from our servers.

If we need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your info and your country requires parental consent, we might ask for your parents’ go-ahead before we collect and use that info.

## Links to Other Websites
Our Service might have links to other websites that we don’t run. If you click on a third-party link, you’ll get shunted over to that third party’s site. We seriously recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of every site you swing by.

We’ve got no control over, and don't take any responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy
We might tweak our Privacy Policy from time to time. We'll let you know about any changes by slapping the new Privacy Policy up on this page.

Before the changes kick in, we’ll give you a heads-up via email and/or a noticeable announcement on our Service and update the "Last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.

It’s a good idea to peek at this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are good to go when they’re posted on this page.
