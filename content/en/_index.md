### **AI Product & Feature Updates**

1.  **OpenAI** just announced it's acquiring **Crossing Minds**, a company specializing in AI recommendation systems for e-commerce, and their team has joined OpenAI. This move aims to supercharge OpenAI's capabilities in key areas like **personalized recommendations**, **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**, and **real-time user modeling**, speeding up the rollout of **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)** in real-world applications. This strategic acquisition will also help OpenAI beef up its personalized modeling and e-commerce recommendation systems, expand **ChatGPT**'s commercial use cases, and advance post-training user fine-tuning and behavior understanding systems. 🚀✨ ['More details'](https://www.crossingminds.com/)
