#### **Social Media Shares**

1.  In a recent social media share, user **meng shao** dropped an awesome comparison test🎥🍝🏎️ of three **AI video products**: **Midjourney**, **Veo3**, and **Hailuo**! She used the exact same prompt to check out how differently they performed when generating a video of "flying spaghetti driving a car." Talk about a visual feast! You can totally watch the video provided to get a direct feel for how each model stacks up.

2.  Xiangyang Qiaomu is absolutely raving🤯🌌🏗️ about the physics effects of the **Hailuo 02 model**, saying it conjures up a "living, breathing" interactive **virtual world**, and its **physical understanding** is way beyond Veo 3. This model has evolved from "individual realism" to "**interactive realism**" with its environment, showing off stunning results and stronger model capabilities through test cases like collapsing blocks. Seriously, it's mind-blowing!

3.  Baoyu hit the nail on the head🤔🧠💡, pointing out that in the **AI era**, technical **depth** matters way more than **breadth**. Why? Because AI can totally cover for a lack of breadth, but it can't make up for a lack of depth. He stressed that **experts in their field** can still churn out high-quality results even with AI's help, while those who are just "jacks of all trades, masters of none" will struggle to hit excellent levels. This really digs deep into the core idea that AI is all about **empowering specialized skills**, not **totally replacing them**. Something to really chew on!
    ['More Details'](https://x.com/dotey/status/1937352533485171025)

4.  Baoyu also brought up the hot discussion💻💸🧐 around **AI code generation quality**. He pointed out that in big projects, the code quality from **Claude Code** just isn't as good as the more expensive combo of **Cline + Gemini 2.5 Pro**, and the former needs way more human tweaking. This doesn't just show how wildly different various **AI models** are when it comes to generating code; it also spills the tea on the **high costs** that can come with chasing **top-notch AI-assisted programming**. Talk about a love-hate balancing act!
