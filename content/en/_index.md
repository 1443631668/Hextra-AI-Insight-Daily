4.  💡 wwwgoubuli highlighted Corey Chiu's **Vibe Coding best practice solution**, emphasizing that its essence lies in **optimizing development steps**, rather than getting hung up on choosing specific models. 🤔 This solution is super insightful for both human and **AI** collaboration! It cleverly combines **Cursor** and **Claude Code** to build a **complete workflow** that's **efficient and smooth** from idea to code implementation 👍. Check out more details here: ['more details'](https://x.com/wwwgoubuli/status/1938794235106558301).

5.  ✍️ Mu Yao penned a post absolutely raving about **Gemini 2.5 Pro**'s writing style, saying its expressions are "deep, appropriate, lively, rich, and fresh." He thinks it totally blows DeepSeek's "greasy style" and GPT-4.5's blandness out of the water. 😮 He even feels Gemini 2.5 Pro's writing is on par with his own best output, making him "despair" at how powerful AI has become 😂! More details: ['https://m.okjike.com/originalPosts/685f594d17aacc074df87b7c'](https://m.okjike.com/originalPosts/685f594d17aacc074df87b7c)

6.  🏆 NVIDIA AI Developer recently unveiled the three winning projects from their Agent Toolkit Hackathon: **cuOptIQ**, which focuses on optimizing factory forklift paths; **OpenCodeReview**, which automates code security analysis and vulnerability detection; and the **Holistic Travel Assistant**, which totally revolutionizes travel planning 🗺️! These projects really showcase the massive potential of connecting **AI agents** using the NVIDIA Agent Intelligence toolkit. More details: ['https://x.com/NVIDIAAIDev/status/1938688505376297192'](https://x.com/NVIDIAAIDev/status/1938688505376297192)

7.  ⚠️ wwwgoubuli brought up a crucial point: it's not a good idea to throw all your rules into one massive, long text prompt, because that can easily lead to missed instructions. 🤔 He reckons a better strategy is to **layer things**, use **multi-agent processing**, and let each agent handle its specific role, instead of blindly mimicking models (like Claude) that just cram all instructions in one go. That's some real insight! More details: ['https://x.com/wwwgoubuli/status/1938647120812356008'](https://x.com/wwwgoubuli/status/1938647120812356008)
